# Seismic P-wave Detection using Python and ObsPy

## Overview
This project demonstrates seismic signal processing and P-wave arrival detection using Python. 
We use a **real earthquake waveform** recorded at the COP station (Denmark) on **Feb 19, 2009**.

Key objectives:
- Download a real seismic waveform using ObsPy.
- Apply bandpass filtering (0.5–8 Hz) to isolate earthquake signals.
- Estimate noise and detect P-wave arrival automatically.
- Visualize raw and filtered waveforms with the P-wave marked.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming for scientific computing
- Signal processing and data analysis
- Seismology fundamentals (P-wave detection)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Reproducibility of scientific workflows
